## API Integration

The app fetches a list of valid tags from the **Cataas API** using the following service:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://cataas.com/api',
});

export const fetchCatTags = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/tags');
  return response.data?.filter((e) => !!e && e.length > 1);
};
```

- **Base URL**: `https://cataas.com/api`
- **Endpoint**: `/tags`
- **Filter**: Only includes tags with a length greater than 1.

3. If the tag is valid, it will appear as a chip in the collection.

### Error Messages
